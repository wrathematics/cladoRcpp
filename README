This package implements in C++/Rcpp various cladogenesis-related 
calculations that are slow in pure R.  These include the calculation of the
probability of various scenarios for the inheritance of geographic range at
the divergence events on a phylogenetic tree, and other calculations 
necessary for models which are not continuous-time markov chains (CTMC), 
but where change instead occurs instantaneously at speciation events.  
Typically these models must assess the probability of every possible 
combination of (ancestor state, left descendent state, right descendent 
state).  This means that there are up to (# of states)^3 combinations to 
investigate, and in biogeographical models, there can easily be hundreds of
states, so calculation time becomes an issue.  C++ implementation plus 
clever tricks (many combinations can be eliminated a priori) can greatly 
speed the computation time over naive R implementations.
